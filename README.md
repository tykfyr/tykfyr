### Hey, I’m René — builder of tools, breaker of things, occasional fixer.

Not everything here makes sense — but it made sense when I wrote it. Probably.

- 🛠️ Composer packages I swear I’ll document later  
- 🧪 Weird experiments (some legal, mostly PHP)  
- 🐘 Laravel, Magento, Shopware, WordPress and other crimes against humanity  
- 📦 Stuff that almost works on my machine™

## Projects I keep feeding after midnight

- `tykfyr/openid-connect-php`: OpenID wrangling with duct tape  
- `tykfyr/cpr-danish-validate`: Because CPR numbers are weird  
- `tykfyr/ntfy-php`: Push notifications for people who like pain
